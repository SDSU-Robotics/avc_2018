# avc_2018
Custom ROS package for the 2018 AVC Logistics Class competition

If you do not already have a catkin workspace set up, run the following

`mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src`
`cd ~/catkin_ws/src`

Once your in the src folder for your workspace, clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/SDSU-Robotics/avc_2018.git`

You can then create a branch for yourself and create pull requests once your code is ready.

To switch to a different branch, run:

`git checkout BRANCH-NAME`

To create a branch, run

`git checkout -b BRANCH-NAME`

Make sure you are branching from the branch you want to be branching from! Checkout master first before creating your branch (unless you actually want to branch off another branch).
